# microseismic_stochastic
The source codes are in MATLAB for microseismic location with stochastic algorithms (e.g. PSO, DE, and NA).

Attached codes are open source files for a research paper published in Computers & Geosciences (Li et al. 2019) and the codes are in MATLAB for microseismic location with PSO, DE, and NA. Detailed description about the methods and algorithms can be found in the related manuscript.

steiner2drec: the synthetic waveforms, only vertical component is considered here

TTSTEINERP: the traveltime table of P-wave (which is too big to upload and can be obtained by request, or generated using following velocity model)

steiner2008p: the P-wave velocity model


The information of the velocity model and microseismic event in these codes can be found in Li et al. 2017.

Though only 2D codes are provided, they can be easily extended to 3D cases.
